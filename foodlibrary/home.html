        <h3>introduction</h3>
        <p>how can we describe the culinary world of los angeles? the food is amazing, with cultural representation from all over the world. 
            restaurants are bringing forward dishes that are delicious and picture worthy. influencers are constantly trying to highlight the next restaurant to go to, but 
            in times of recession, it's hard to keep up with the next dish you want to go out and try.</p>
        
        <p>while restaurants do an amazing job at perfecting their craft, some dishes are not as intimidating to prepare as it may seem. 
                some of the best foods i have tasted at these must haves in la can be replicated from the comfort of your own kitchen at a 
            fraction of the price (if you prepare lots of it because groceries are also getting expensive).</p>
